Vishal is a NASA Einstein Fellow at Columbia University who studies gravitational wave astrophysics. His research focuses on understanding the origins of gravitational wave sources, particularly how compact-object binaries, such as pairs of black holes and neutron stars, form and evolve. Although mergers of these objects have been detected by observatories like LIGO, Virgo, and Kagra, their exact origins and formation processes remain unclear. Vishal's work aims to address key questions about how, when, and where these binaries form, as well as the stellar environments that shape them.
